# WHATS ALREADY DONE:
 - Every method thats proposed in challenge.md is already done.

# WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
  ## Change the structure:
    - Lets change a little bit the structure of the project. Creating the folder controller and repository, to separate the code by layers;

  ## Add the new entity "client" to  the project:
    - Create the entity client, to separate the transactions and receivables by the clients;
    - The methods to get the transactions, receivables and values can be separated by client;

  ## Add authentication to the project:
    - Lets implement a JWT authentication security system to the project;
    - Each user must have a account to access the system;
    - There will be two types of users: client and admin;
    - While the admin has accress to the whole database, the client has access only to the data related to him;
